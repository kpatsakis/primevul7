	 * Sometimes, even reliable TSCs go backwards.  This happens on
	 * platforms that reset TSC during suspend or hibernate actions, but
	 * maintain synchronization.  We must compensate.  Fortunately, we can
	 * detect that condition here, which happens early in CPU bringup,
	 * before any KVM threads can be running.  Unfortunately, we can't
	 * bring the TSCs fully up to date with real time, as we aren't yet far
	 * enough into CPU bringup that we know how much real time has actually
	 * elapsed; our helper function, get_kernel_ns() will be using boot
	 * variables that haven't been updated yet.
	 *
	 * So we simply find the maximum observed TSC above, then record the
	 * adjustment to TSC in each VCPU.  When the VCPU later gets loaded,
	 * the adjustment will be applied.  Note that we accumulate
	 * adjustments, in case multiple suspend cycles happen before some VCPU
	 * gets a chance to run again.  In the event that no KVM threads get a
	 * chance to run, we will miss the entire elapsed period, as we'll have
	 * reset last_host_tsc, so VCPUs will not have the TSC adjusted and may
	 * loose cycle time.  This isn't too big a deal, since the loss will be
	 * uniform across all VCPUs (not to mention the scenario is extremely
	 * unlikely). It is possible that a second hibernate recovery happens
	 * much faster than a first, causing the observed TSC here to be
	 * smaller; this would require additional padding adjustment, which is
	 * why we set last_host_tsc to the local tsc observed here.
	 *
	 * N.B. - this code below runs only on platforms with reliable TSC,
	 * as that is the only way backwards_tsc is set above.  Also note
	 * that this runs for ALL vcpus, which is not a bug; all VCPUs should
	 * have the same delta_cyc adjustment applied if backwards_tsc
	 * is detected.  Note further, this adjustment is only done once,
	 * as we reset last_host_tsc on all VCPUs to stop this from being
	 * called multiple times (one for each physical CPU bringup).
	 *
	 * Platforms with unreliable TSCs don't have to deal with this, they
	 * will be compensated by the logic in vcpu_load, which sets the TSC to
	 * catchup mode.  This will catchup all VCPUs to real time, but cannot
	 * guarantee that they stay in perfect synchronization.
