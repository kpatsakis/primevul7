    * the filter is the first transformation performed on the row data.  It is
    * performed in place, therefore an implementation can be selected based on
    * the image pixel format.  If the implementation depends on image width then
    * take care to ensure that it works correctly if the image is interlaced -
    * interlacing causes the actual row width to vary.
